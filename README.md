# Venus - Backend Technical Test

## Introduction

This is a backend tech assessment, where you'll build a simple API. The goal of this exercise is to showcase your skills and your problem solving thought process.

## Resources

Please use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to start the containers required for this technical test.

By running `docker compose up`, Docker will build the containers, seed the database with data and start the dev servers.

API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8181`

For more details and the expected outcomes, refer to the README file in the backend folder.

## Exercise

Your goal is to build up the backend API, using this opportunity to demonstrate your skills. To begin, fork this repository to your GitHub account. Once the test is complete, please send the URL of your public repository to gleiser@venus.io.

Good luck!
